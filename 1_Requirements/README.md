# Student Record Management System




# INTRODUCTION
Student record management software is a tool that tracks and records regular activities of the students in institutes including attendance, and their behavior.
The software can be accessed by students, teachers, admin and parents with a role-based login. It collects all the student data along with their personal information which can be easily searched and retrieved later on. The software stores years of data online on a cloud platform. Collecting information can come handy when there is a huge inflow of data.

# Objective
The main objective of the student record management system is to provide a tool to efficiently record all data necessary, and also sort it.
The people using it only have to choose what they have to do, and enter the data,everything else is taken care of by the program.

# SWOT ANALYSIS
Strength
It is very useful for staff to generate record of all the students enrolled. It is usefull for all colleges and schools. 

# Weakness
It may fail to hold record if the students exceeds a particular limit.

# Oppurtunity
User can generate all student records.


# Existing System
Looking at the existing student record managemnet system, it is found that many educational institutions, mainly engineering colleges lack when it comes to handling huge amounts of data at the time of registration, such management system can be used to scale the existing system to a more efficient one



# Features
Two main features of this project are: entering record in the syste,. Both these functions are done automatically by this software application. Some other features of the project are save, cancel and exit from the application.

The marksheet entry form includes “student details” and “grade points obtained” by the student. Students’ name, registration number, exam roll no., semester, courses and exam type are to be provided in student details. All these information are saved in the system.

# REQUIREMENTS
High level requirements
Accept yours Registration ID total, if you don't want to continue then press 'N', else press 'Y'.

# LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
Hardware requirement
RAM: 1 GB or above. Hard disk: Minimum 20 GB free space. Processor: Pentium 4 (1.6 GHz) or higher.

Software requirement
Operating system: Windows XP/ 2000/ Visual studio code/ 7/ 8/ 10. Front End: Microsoft Visual studio 2005.


# Threats

Public sector leaders are still less motivated in daily usage of MIS.
Data loading from source systems are done manually and infrequently in certain cases and it has a negative impact on the availability of MIS reports.

# Requirements (High level and Low level)

High-level and low-level, as technical terms, are used to classify, describe and point to specific goals of a systematic operation; and are applied in a wide range of contexts, such as, for instance, in domains as widely varied as computer science and business administration. High-level describe those operations that are more abstract in nature; wherein the overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider, macro system as a whole. Low-level describes more specific.
